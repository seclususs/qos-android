> ⚠️ **WARNING:** This module is designed and tested on devices with hardware characteristics similar to MediaTek Helio G88–class SoCs and eMMC-based internal storage. Behavior may vary across manufacturers, kernels, and ROMs. Devices with significantly different hardware (e.g. UFS storage, high-end SoCs) or missing/modified kernel PSI support may experience unstable behavior. Misuse may lead to severe instability, bootloops, or data loss. Proceed **ONLY** if you know exactly what you are doing.
